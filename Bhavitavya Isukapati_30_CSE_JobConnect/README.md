JobConnect â€“ A Full-Stack Job Portal

JobConnect is a web-based job portal developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. It is designed to simplify the process of job searching and recruitment. The platform enables users to register, browse job listings, and apply for positions directly through an interactive interface. Each job listing includes detailed information, and users can submit their applications through a built-in form, which also triggers an email confirmation to the applicant.

For recruiters and administrators, the system includes an admin dashboard that provides functionality to add new job postings, view submitted applications, and monitor platform activity through a simple interface. The application also supports secure login using JWT authentication, ensures proper form validation, and manages user sessions effectively. All user and job data is stored in a secure MongoDB Atlas database, and the frontend is styled using Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive user experience.

The project fulfills the core objective of bridging the gap between job seekers and employers by providing an efficient, easy-to-use digital recruitment solution. It was developed as part of an academic internship/project submission.
